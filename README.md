The original implementation version of MM 2023 paper **ROAD: Robust Unsupervised Domain Adaptation with Noisy Labels**. The [Office-31](https://faculty.cc.gatech.edu/~judy/domainadapt/) and [Office-Home](https://www.hemanthdv.org/officeHomeDataset.html) dataset should be put into ./data/ wherever appropriate. *cd pytorch* and *bash road_run.sh* to start the training.

A more comprehensive version will be updated shortly.
